# API Types

We have two types of API methods:

* Methods which retrieve raw data offering you complete flexibility to create your own solutions (marked with Batch)
* Methods which allow you to manipulate clients and reports stored within your BrightLocal control panel (marked with Account)

The first type requires you to submit your requests as part of a batch - a container which makes it easy to bundle up multiple requests and poll for all results. [You can read more about batches below.](#batches)
