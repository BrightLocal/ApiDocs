# API Wrapper

If you work with PHP or C# we have API wrappers which simplify authentication against our API and provide simple methods for making requests.

The PHP and C# examples in this documentation use these wrappers.

* PHP - [https://github.com/BrightLocal/BrightLocal-API-Helper](https://github.com/BrightLocal/BrightLocal-API-Helper)
* C# - [https://github.com/BrightLocal/C-Sharp-Api-Wrapper](https://github.com/BrightLocal/C-Sharp-Api-Wrapper) or via NuGet at [https://www.nuget.org/packages/BrightLocal/1.0.0/](https://www.nuget.org/packages/BrightLocal/1.0.0/).
