# API Wrapper

If you work with PHP or C# we have API wrappers which simplify authentication against our API and provide simple methods for making requests.

The PHP and C# examples in this documentation use these wrappers.

* PHP - [https://github.com/BrightLocal/apiclient-php](https://github.com/BrightLocal/apiclient-php) or via Composer at [https://packagist.org/packages/brightlocal/apiclient-php](https://packagist.org/packages/brightlocal/apiclient-php)
* C# - [https://github.com/BrightLocal/apiclient-csharp](https://github.com/BrightLocal/apiclient-csharp) or via NuGet at [https://www.nuget.org/packages/Brigthlocal.apiclient-csharp/2.0.0.15](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Brigthlocal.apiclient-csharp/2.0.0.15).
