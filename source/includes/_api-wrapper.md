# API Wrapper

If you work with PHP we have an API wrapper which simplifies authentication against our API and provides simple methods for making requests. The PHP examples in this documentation use the wrapper and it's available at [https://github.com/BrightLocal/BrightLocal-API-Helper](https://github.com/BrightLocal/BrightLocal-API-Helper).
